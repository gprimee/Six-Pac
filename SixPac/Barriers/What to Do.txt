What to work on now: 
Protein bar spawning

Advice - Use a Pac-Man map for a reference
on how frequently the bars will spawn. Even
if Six Pac's movement doesn't work properly, Six Pac 
should still be able to interact with the protein bars and make 
them disappear. 

It would also be useful to create a score board of some sort and add points
to it whenever a protein bar is consumed.
